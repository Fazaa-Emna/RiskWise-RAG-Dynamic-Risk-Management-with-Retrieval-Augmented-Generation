# RiskWise-RAG: Dynamic Risk Management with Retrieval-Augmented Generation

Welcome to **RiskWise-RAG**, an advanced, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline designed to enhance decision-making in project risk management. This project leverages a combination of natural language processing, graph databases, and dynamic information retrieval to deliver real-time, context-aware insights for mitigating project risks effectively.

## Overview
Traditional risk management tools rely on static data or require extensive manual fine-tuning. **RiskWise-RAG** solves this by dynamically retrieving data from a wide range of information sources and risk databases in real-time. By using a RAG approach, it enables dynamic, context-aware responses to user queries, providing relevant insights and recommendations for proactive risk management in project contexts.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Information Retrieval**: Leverages dynamic data sources, providing up-to-date insights into risk factors.
- **Graph-Enhanced Query Embedding**: Uses Neo4j to identify similar risks and related topics, enhancing recommendation relevance.
- **Clustering and Similarity Analysis**: Groups and identifies similar risk patterns, improving decision-making strategies.
- **Customized Query Embedding**: User queries are matched with relevant risks through specialized embeddings, ensuring precise responses.
- **RAG-Based Response Generation**: Combines retrieved data with generated responses, ensuring answers are both accurate and contextually enhanced.
- **Feedback and Continuous Learning**: User feedback integration refines model responses over time, making recommendations increasingly precise.


## Pipeline Architecture
1. **Data Retrieval**: Searches and retrieves relevant data from Neo4j and other sources to provide up-to-date and contextually relevant information.
2. **Embedding Generation**: Generates custom embeddings for user queries to identify related risk nodes and improve response accuracy.
3. **Clustering and Similarity Analysis**: Groups similar risks to identify patterns and insights, aiding decision-makers in assessing related risks more efficiently.
4. **Response Generation**: Utilizes the RAG model to combine retrieved data with generated responses, forming complete, contextually aware answers to user queries.
5. **User Feedback Loop**: Continuously improves the system by integrating user feedback, refining the accuracy and relevance of recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- **Neo4j**: A graph database that stores and retrieves complex risk relations, enabling efficient graph-based similarity searches.
- **PyTorch & PyTorch Geometric**: Facilitates graph data processing and embedding generation, utilizing Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Deep Graph Infomax (DGI).
- **Transformers & Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Powers the response generation process, ensuring relevance and context for dynamic answers.
- **KMeans Clustering**: Used for identifying patterns and clustering related risks, simplifying analysis.
- **t-SNE & Matplotlib**: Provides visualization tools for embedding data and cluster insights, aiding users in understanding risk distributions.

## Examples
```python
# Sample Query
query = "Identify potential financial risks in the current quarter."
response = pipeline.answer_query(query)
print("Risk Assessment:", response)

# View Similar Risk Patterns
pipeline.view_clusters()  # Visualizes related risks in clusters for user review
```
